## Procedure to withdraw money from an ATM
Perform the following steps to withdraw money from an ATM:

Step 1: Insert your Debit or Credit card into the designated card slot. Make sure your card is facing the right way when you insert it.

Step 2: Select a language.

Step 3: Enter your **Personal Identification Number** (**PIN**), a number usually containing four digits that you established or your bank assigned to you when you opened your account.

Step 4: Select **Withdraw** when the ATM prompts you to choose the type of transaction you would like to make.

Step 5: Select the account you want to withdraw money from. For example, if you have both Current and Savings account but you want to withdraw cash from your current account, select Current. You will receive this prompt from an ATM only if you have multiple accounts.

Step 6: Select the amount of cash you want to withdraw. 
> **Note**: Ensure you are aware of daily withdrawal limits before you withdraw cash at an ATM. In case, you enter the amount exceeding the daily withdrawal limit, an error message will prompt on the ATM screen.

Step 7: Take your cash, receipt, and card when they come out of the ATM.
